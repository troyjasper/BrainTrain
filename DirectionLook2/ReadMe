Done:
- display an arrow
- get input
- visually respond to input
	- also works with mouse clicking
- move the arrow on input
- basic scoring system
- other bird spawning and locations
- flocking pattern switcher (just a script variable right now)
	- square
	- ring
	- solo
- distractions all point together, in a random direction

Todo:
- basically every phone functionality, particularly swipe and tap input
- the spacing of the decoys is too far
- in-game switches and toggles for most game changing variables (flock shape)
- have the decoys be a different colour than the main bird
- the arrow can move onto the input buttons, prevent this
- for a difficulty meter, add various options that will increase or decrease a numeric value
	- e.g., all distractions point the same way is making it easier, always pointing a different way is a bit harder, and sometimes pointing the same way makes it much harder
	- having the shape change each reappearance is harder
- add distractions
	- add different flocking patterns
		- V (5)
		- small "V" (3)
		- cross of four
		- "flock" cross of thirteen (9 square with four more cardinal directions)
		- short line (3)
		- long line (5)
- art and design
	-currently using a Kenny arrow asset to represent the "birds"
	-backgrounds, currently floating in a black void
- animation
	- how should things appear and disappear? snapping into existence isn't great
- particles?
	- feathers for birds
	- sparkles for arrows?
- sound
	- correct
	- incorrect
	- music
	- ambience
- pause menu
- clock
